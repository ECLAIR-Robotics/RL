# Task 4 - CNNs

## Installation

You can use the following link to install pytorch: [here](https://pytorch.org/). If you scroll down, you can customize the type of environment/computer you're using to get a customized command to install pytorch. This assignment is from the official pytorch examples (all credits go to them) but please do not look/cheat off of that example! (we'll know)

## Instructions

For this coding challenge, you'll be implementing a basic classified trying to classify various images of planes, cars, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

In terms of coding, we have labeled "TODO"s as to where you need to code. Since there's a lot of things with ML, we've restricted the code fo this challenge to be just you making a model and then doing a timestep on that model as well as playing around with a couple hyperparameter constants (3 'TODO's in total). If you can get an accuracy of 75% or higher, you should be good! Note: You most likely will need to look at the documentation for pytorch, which will probably house most of the challenging parts of this assignment. If you're already familiar with pytorch, however, it should be easier for you!

This week's assignment is very similar to last week's assignment, but the only difference is that we're changing the network architecture to be a CNN. We'll tackle Deep Q-Learning next week. This might be slightly tricky if you don't have experience with model creation in pytorch (since you'll have to use pool functions, relus, etc), but the online documentation should help a lot!

Important note: for this assignment, there's no "grading" per se, so just try your best! You may need to tune the hyperparameters (~fancy~ word for epsilon, step size, discount rate, and other constants) in order to replicate the results, but feel free to mess around with things and no worries if you can't get things exact!

Best wishes! :)))
