# Task 1 - Epsilon Greedy

## Installation

```
conda install -c conda-forge gym
```

Usually, you can use the following install for the actual gym_bandits located [here](https://github.com/JKCooper2/gym-bandits).
This pip install only works on Linux (maybe Mac). I tried it on WSL2 but no dice fam. However, the repository is setup so that
it should just run without any issues. Credits to the original repository though.
